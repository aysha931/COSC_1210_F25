### ----- Bugs and Future Ideas   ----- 
- Sometimes the balls spawn too close to the goose and the game ends too quickly
- Once in a while, the game looses immediately after restart
- Add additional levels so as the player wins, the game changes in some way
- Add additional objectives: move an item? collect different objects? avoid balls and static mines?
- Add sounds
- Allow goose to take damage rather than losing after one ball hit
